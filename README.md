# PyBer Analysis

## Overview 

V. Isualize, the CEO of the multi Billion dollar company PyBer, a ride-sharing service, has tasked us with performing analysis on two csv files filled with ride-sharing data from cities across the county. We are to summarize the data into city type (urban, suburban, and rural) to determine the coverage of drivers and riders across the difference city types as well as determining the fares in each location. In the end we created a line graph that shows the total fares for each city type for a week from January to April of 2019. This provides a visualization of how the data differs in different types of cities.  

## Results - There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

To begin this analysis we determined the following information for each city type from the merged .csv files: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fare by city type. This is all displayed in the PyBer_Summary_df DataFrame.
